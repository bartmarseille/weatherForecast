TensorFlow weather forecast model
that tries to map weather parameters Pin at tn to the next hour parameter values Pout(tn+1) and has 2 hidden layers.
The dataset is preprocessed and normalized.
During model training the accuracy, entropy, weight and bias dynamics are visualized using matplotlib to help with hyperparameter optimization.
Model scoring is done by presenting test data and letting the model dream by presenting Pout as Pin for 24 iterations/hours.
Although good weather forecasts were not expected, the dreaming model shows clear day-night patterns and does not run out of the expected data range boundaries.
